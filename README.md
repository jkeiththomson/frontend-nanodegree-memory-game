## Instructions

This is my version of the Memory Game Project, which is part of the Udacity nanodegree course in Front-End Web Development.

To get started, clone this repository, then open `index.html` in your browser of choice and start clicking on cards. Your goal is to match all eight pairs of cards.

## Contributing

This repository is forked from the starter code repository from Udacity. Pull requests will not be reviewed or accepted.
